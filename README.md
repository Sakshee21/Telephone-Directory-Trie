# Telephone Directory using Trie Data Structure

This is my first DSA project in during my first year which is implemented in the C language. As I began my journey exploring the C language, this implementation set up a benchmark in my future DSA journey. 

A person can either add records that is the name followed by the telephone number or either search for a record. Here only search by name is implemented using the trie data structure for searching the records.
